# 01 Map Reads

Script to map the RNAseq reads to a genomic reference.  I will use John's S. div Hifi ASM.  

## Assembly info

Assembly is on Box at https://ucdavis.app.box.com/folder/190583930929

Assembly is on LSSC0 at `/share/malooflab/ref_genomes/S_diversifolious/Sdiv.2023HiFiasm`

## Reads info

Apex libraries were sequenced in three pools.  There was an error made in sequencing Apex1--it was combined with another library that had incompatible indexes, so many (but not all) samples were clobbered.  It was resequences later.

Location of Apex2 and Apex3 round 1 reads:

  /share/malooflab/Fastqs/Dimensions/hydrothermal_2022-09-20
  # Note there are seed reads in there as well, so take care when specifiying files
  
Location of Apex1 round 1 reads:

  /share/malooflab/Fastqs/Dimensions/hydrothermal_2022-09-20-apex1-redo/good

Location of round 2 reads:

  /share/malooflab/Fastqs/Dimensions/hydrothermal_apex_2023-07-24/FASTQ_0292
  /share/malooflab/Fastqs/Dimensions/hydrothermal_apex_2023-07-24/FASTQ_0293
